# Astroids

BootDev guided project, link to project page: [https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-asteroids](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-asteroids)

**Description:**

Build a clone of the classic Asteroids game using Pygame and object-oriented programming concepts. This guided project will help you understand how to use Pygame to create a game loop, handle user input, and manage game state. You'll also learn how to use object-oriented programming to create game objects and manage their interactions. 

**Extension ideas:**

* Add a scoring system
* Implement multiple lives and respawning
* Add an explosion effect for the asteroids
* Add acceleration to the player movement
* Make the objects wrap around the screen instead of disappearing
* Add a background image
* Create different weapon types
* Make the asteroids lumpy instead of perfectly round
* Make the ship have a triangular hit box instead of a circular one
* Add a shield power-up
* Add a speed power-up
* Add bombs that can be dropped
